# Project 1: Regression Analysis of Manchester United's 2022/23 Season
- Implemented logistic regression to determine the log(odds) of a Man Utd win based on match statistics in the 22/23 season
- Used Backwards Stepwise Regression to find candidate model based on lowest AIC
- Added weights to the regression model to address the imbalanced dataset
- Utilised Ridge Penalisation to combat multicollinearity
- Conducted Leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) for training and testing
- Measured the model's predictive ability using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC-ROC
- Hypothesis testing for Goodness-of-fit (Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness of fit, deviance under chi-sq distribution)
- Highlighted Actionable Insights for Improvement to Man Utd's way of playing
